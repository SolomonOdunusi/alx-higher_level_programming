## Project Description

This project focuses on network programming in Python, specifically dealing with fetching resources from the internet, making HTTP requests, and handling responses. The tasks involve using libraries such as `urllib` and `requests` to achieve these goals.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to fetch internet resources using the Python package `urllib`
- Understand how to decode `urllib` body responses
- Gain proficiency in using the Python package `requests` for making HTTP requests
- Learn to make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, etc., requests
- Understand how to fetch and manipulate JSON resources from external services

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using wc
- Modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key
- Documentation should be real sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method
- Code should not execute when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`
